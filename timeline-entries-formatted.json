The practice of appointing unpaid attachés to diplomatic missions was forbidden. President Franklin Pierce, Secretary of State [Marcy](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/marcy-william-learned), and Attorney General Caleb Cushing concluded that the law imposed unconstitutional restraints on the President\u2019s power of appointment by requiring them to appoint representatives of certain grades to specific countries.\n\nThe Act divided consulates and commercial agencies into two classes: Schedule B and Schedule C. Schedule B posts had salaries ranging from $1,000 to $7,500; persons assigned to them could not engage in trade. Schedule C posts paid $300 to $1,000; trade was permissible but fees could not be kept. Holders of 30 posts not listed in either schedule could trade and keep their fees. The Act also provided for the appointment of up to 25 \u201cconsular pupils,\u201d who were expected to become the nucleus of a professional consular corps. Consuls were to collect receipts for fees received and to report annually on money collected.\n\nAfter passage of the Act, the Department published its first _General Instructions to the Consuls and Commercial Agents of the United States._ Future editions of _Consular Regulations_ were published in 1857, 1870, 1874, 1881, 1888, and 1896."

One Assistant Secretary assumed charge of international economic and financial affairs, replacing the Office of the Adviser on International Economic Affairs. Another assumed charge of administration and public information. A third assumed charge of controls, transportation, and communications. The fourth was responsible for Congressional liaison. An Office of Foreign Service Administration was established under direction of the Assistant Secretary for Administration. The four geographical Divisions became Offices, with the former Advisors on Political Relations becoming Office Directors. An Executive Assistant to the Secretary was established to administer the Secretary\u2019s immediate office while another reviewed correspondence for the Secretary\u2019s signature. The Special Division became the Special War Problems Division. This, along with the Passport, Visa, and Foreign Activity Correlation Divisions, comprised the Office of Controls.\n\nTwelve Offices were established to oversee the various Divisions. The Directors of the four geographical offices and a new Office of Special Political Affairs reported to the Under Secretary. The latter organization was charged with preparations for a postwar international organization and included a Division of International Organization Affairs. The Protocol Division was under the Office of Departmental Administration.\n\nAn Office of Public Information was established, containing Divisions of: Current Information; Research and Publication; Motion Pictures and Radio; and Science, Education, and Art. The Division of Research and Publication replaced the Office of the Editor of Treaties. A Division of Labor Relations was also established.\n\nTwo organizations were established for long-range planning: the Policy Committee and the Committee on Postwar Programs.\n\nThe reorganization plan eliminated the Office of the Chief Clerk and Administrative Assistant, transferring its duties to the Division of Administrative Management. The Office of Coordination and Review was also eliminated, but was re-established as part of the Division of Communications and Records a month later. A Central Translating Division replaced the Central Translating Office and the Translating Bureau. The Treaty Division was abolished and its functions transferred to the Legal Adviser\u2019s Office. A Division of Budget and Finance replaced the Division of Accounts and the Office of Fiscal and Budgetary Affairs.\n\nConducted in relative secrecy and haste with little consultation among senior officers of the Department, the January 15 reorganization was subsequently adjusted by 33 Department Orders through December 20."
