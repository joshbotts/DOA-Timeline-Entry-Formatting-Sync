It recommended unification of the Department and Foreign Service\n                        personnel systems “where their official functions converge,” and estimated\n                        that up to 3,700 positions could be filled by FSOs. Non-Foreign Service\n                        personnel holding such positions should be incorporated into the Foreign\n                        Service within 2 years, or else moved into non-Foreign Service positions or\n                        out of the Department. The Foreign Service Reserve would still provide\n                        specialists on a temporary basis. The Foreign Service Staff would still\n                        provide support personnel. Secretary Dulles\n                        announced his acceptance of the Wriston Report on September 8.
